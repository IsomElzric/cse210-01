I actually really relied on git for this project, while I have my desktop where I usually do most of my schoolwork, this week I've been running around quite a lot, and being able to just clone my repo onto my laptop as well has made this extremely easy to keep up with my changes and my hectic schedule. As our projects get bigger and much more involved I know just how important it is to use git and the ease that comes with it.
